# FullfilApp 
# Unofficial PHP SDK for The Fulfillment Lab API

This is a complete SDK supporting all of The Fulfillment Lab's API functionality.

It was designed to be as simple as possible due to being needed in both a Magento 1.x and new Magento 2.x storefront. Permission was granted by the client to release under the LGPL license. 

It has been tested as thoroughly as possible against a "dummy" endpoint mimicing TFL's API, however said client decided not to go forward with TFL's services so it has not been tested against their actual API - bug reports, patches, and suggestions are welcome.

This library is not supported or associated with The Fulfillment Lab themselves.

## Dependencies

Requires Httpful which facilitates all communication with the API.

## Usage

Mainly self-explanatory. See tests.php for example code.
